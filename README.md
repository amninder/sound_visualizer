========
This project already contains build files except index.html, you'll be needing Adobe Flash CS to re-build the project.

1. open index.as to read the code
2. index.fla is the file you'll be using

inorder to play your own song, copy the song in the same directory/folderas index.swf file with the file name mentioned in the line 19.
re place the electronice.mp3 with you own path to the file (not forgetting to mention to the name in quotes)
